This project focuses on the decoding Formula One telemetry data in the form of encoded UDP packets by the simulator F1 2021 by Codemasters. Telemetry gathered by the simulator includes the playerâ€™s car speed, steering, throttle, tyre temperatures, lap times, and more. Data analysis can be done on certain telemetry data in order to calculate information like average lap speed, tyre degradation levels, and predicted lap performance. This project will use a combination of C and Python to receive and display this data. Data will be sent out from the simulator in encoded UDP packets and received by a PIC24 16-bit microprocessor running C. All data analysis will be done in the microprocessor, and a new data packet including current speed, throttle input, brake input, steering input, and lap time will be formed. This new packet will be sent out via CAN communication protocol to a different microprocessor running a Python script. In Python, the new packet will be decoded, parsed, and displayed in real-time updating MatPlotLib graphs. This project serves as a proof of concept regarding data analysis and transfer on microprocessors using CAN communication protocols. Most modern cars do exactly this, especially in Formula One cars. Data analytics and processing is critical to success in a racing scenario.
